### Internship-Verzeo-Project-June-2022
### Given a diabetes.csv dataset, we have to predict whether a person has diabetes or not using the given features. We first have to clean the data by replacing few impossible zero values like Blood pressure, BMI, Insulin, Glucose with NaN values and then replacing those NaN values with the median values of their corresponding columns.
### Later on, we draw a correlation plot to determine which features are to be considered. We then make ML models using classifiers (Decision Tree, KNN and SVC) and we also mention each of their accuracies and confusion matrices in order to determine which model is reliable.
